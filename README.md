# Feature-Flag-Impact-Analyzer

A system that quantifies how feature flags affect user behavior, system load, and cost.

## Why it’s unique
Feature flags exist everywhere; impact analysis rarely does.

## Core components
- Event-based metrics comparison
- Pre/post rollout analysis
- Guardrail metrics (latency, error rate, cost)
- Rollback recommendations

## Signals
- Product + data fluency
- Experimentation literacy
- Production mindset
